# Jonathan Sutjandra's First CS193 Homework

## things I like about CS193:
- It teaches me tools that i can apply to later commputer science classes
- It prepares me to use programming tools that are outside of coding
- The TAs are nice and welcoming
- The class takes place in a large area with comfy sseating.
